# numerical-solver
A numerical UI-based system for solving both 'Root Finding' and 'System of Equations' problems, analyzing the behavior of different numerical methods. 
## Main Feautures
- Interactive GUI that enables the user to enter equations containing different functions such as: {poly, exp, cos, sin...}.
- In/Out file handling.
- Plot of the used function behavior.
## Addressed Problems
### 1. Root Finder
Implements and compares the following methods:  
- Bisection
- False Position
- Fixed Point
- Newton-Raphson
- Secant
- Birge-Vieta
### 2. System Solver
Implements and compares the following methods:
- Gaussian Elimination
- LU decomposition
- Gauss-Jordan
- Gauss-Seidel
